<p>
      Jsvc is a set of libraries and applications for making Java
      applications run on UNIX more easily. It can run on win32 via
      the cygwin emulation layer (see 
      <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"> cygwin</a> for more information),
      however win32 users may prefer to use <a href="procrun.html"> procrun</a>
      instead.
</p>
<p>
      The sources are located in the src/native/unix subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
      In the future <a href="http://apr.apache.org/"> APR </a> may be used
      to provide more portable platform support.

<section name="Building from source">
<p>
To build under a UNIX operating system you will need:
<ul>
  <li>GNU AutoConf (at least version 2.53)</li>
  <li>An ANSI-C compliant compiler (GCC is good)</li>
  <li>GNU Make</li>
  <li>A Java Platform 2 compliant SDK</li>
</ul>


You need to build the "configure" program with:

<source>
sh support/buildconf.sh
</source>

(Note it is possible to replace sh by any compatible shell like bash, ksh).

The result should be something like:
<source>
support/buildconf.sh
support/buildconf.sh: configure script generated successfully
</source>
Once the configure script is generated, follow the next section.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Building from a release tarball">
<p>
To build the binary under a UNIX operating system you will need:
<ul>
  <li>An ANSI-C compliant compiler (GCC is good)</li>
  <li>GNU Make</li>
  <li>A Java Platform 2 compliant SDK</li>
</ul>

You have to specify the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> of the SDK
either with the <code>--with-java=&lt;dir&gt;</code> parameter or set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment
to point to your SDK installation. For example:
<source>
./configure --with-java=/usr/java
</source>
or
<source>
export JAVA_HOME
./configure
</source>

If your operating system is supported, configure will go through cleanly,
otherwise it will report an error (please send us the details of your
OS/JDK, or a patch against the sources). To build the binaries and
libraries simply do:
<source>
make
</source>
This will generate the executable file <code>jsvc</code>.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Starting jsvc">
<p>
To check the allowed parameters for the jsvc binary simply do:
<source>
./jsvc -help
Usage: jsvc [-options] class [args...]

Where options include:

    -jvm &lt;JVM name&gt;
        use a specific Java Virtual Machine. Available JVMs:
            'client' 'server'
    -cp / -classpath &lt;directories and zip/jar files&gt;
        set search path for service classes and resouces
    -home &lt;directory&gt;
        set the path of your JDK or JRE installation (or set
        the JAVA_HOME environment variable)
    -version
        show the current Java environment version (to check
        correctness of -home and -jvm. Implies -nodetach)
    -help / -?
        show this help page (implies -nodetach)
    -nodetach
        don't detach from parent process and become a daemon
    -debug
        verbosely print debugging information
    -check
        only check service (implies -nodetach)
    -user &lt;user&gt;
        user used to run the daemon (defaults to current user)
    -verbose[:class|gc|jni]
        enable verbose output
    -outfile &lt;/full/path/to/file&gt;
        Location for output from stdout (defaults to /dev/null)
        Use the value '&amp;2' to simulate '1&gt;&amp;2'
    -errfile &lt;/full/path/to/file&gt;
        Location for output from stderr (defaults to /dev/null)
        Use the value '&amp;1' to simulate '2&gt;&amp;1'
    -pidfile &lt;/full/path/to/file&gt;
        Location for output from the file containing the pid of jsvc
        (defaults to /var/run/jsvc.pid)
    -D&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
        set a Java system property
    -X&lt;option&gt;
        set Virtual Machine specific option
    -procname &lt;process name&gt;
        Allows the process name to be configured on Linux
    -wait &lt;waittime&gt;
        wait waittime seconds for the service to start
        waittime should multiple of 10 (min=10)
    -stop
        stop the service using the file given in the -pidfile option

</source>
</p>

<section name="Using jsvc">
<p>
There two ways to use jsvc: via a Class that implements the Daemon interface or
via calling a Class that has the required methods.
For example Tomcat-4.1.x uses the Daemon interface
whereas Tomcat-5.0.x provides a Class whose methods are called by jsvc directly.
</p>
<subsection name="Via Daemon interface">
<p>
Do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Write a Class that implements the Daemon interface (MyClass).</li>
  <li>Put it in a jarfile (my.jar).</li>
  <li>Call jsvc like:
  <source>
./jsvc -cp commons-daemon.jar:my.jar MyClass
  </source>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="Directly">
<p>
Write a Class (MyClass) that implements the following methods:
<ul>
  <li>void init(String[] arguments): Here open configuration files, create a trace file, create
      ServerSockets, Threads</li>
  <li>void start(): Start the Thread, accept incoming connections</li>
  <li>void stop(): Inform the Thread to terminate the run(), close the ServerSockets</li>
  <li><code>void destroy()</code>: Destroy any object created in init()</li>
</ul>
Store it in a jarfile and use as above:
<source>
./jsvc -cp commons-daemon.jar:my.jar MyClass
</source>
</p>
</subsection>
</section>
<section name="How jsvc works">
<p>
Jsvc uses 3 processes: a launcher process, a controller process and a controlled process.
The controlled process is also the main java thread, if the JVM crashes
the controller will restart it in the next minute.
Jsvc is a daemon process so it should be started as root and the <code>-user</code> parameter
allows to downgrade to an unprivilegded user.
When the <code>-wait</code> parameter is used, the launcher process waits until the controller says
"I am ready", otherwise it returns after creating the controller process.
</p>

<subsection name="Forks in commons-daemon">
<p>
Launcher process:
<source>
main()
{
  fork()
  parent: wait_child(), wait until JAVA service started when the child says "I am ready".
  child: controller process.
}
</source>

Controller process:
<source>
  while (fork()) {
    parent: wait_for_child.
      if exited and restart needed continue
      else exit.
    child: exit(child()). controlled process.
  }
</source>

Controlled process:
<source>
In child(): controlled process.
  init_JVM().
  load_service().
  start_service().
  say "I am ready"
  wait for signal or pool for stop
  stop_service().
  destroy_service().
  destroy_JVM().
  exit (with different codes so that parent knows if it has to restart us).
</source>
Note: The controller process uses signals to stop the controlled process.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Downgrading user">
<p>
On linux <code>setuid()</code>/<code>setgid()</code> + capabilities are used. On other unix <code>setgid</code>/<code>initgroups</code> are used.

We have something like:
<source>
/* as root */
init_JVM().
load_service. /*  java_load() calls the load method */
downgrade user (set_caps() or set_user_group())
/* as the user $USER (from -user $USER parameter) */
umask()
start_service. /* java_start() calls the start method */
</source>
</p>
