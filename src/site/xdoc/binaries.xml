<section name="What to download?">
<p>
In the directory
<a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/commons/daemon/binaries/">binaries</a>
you will find subdirectories containing executables
corresponding to your operating system. If your machine is not in the list,
please mail us and we will try to make it available, or you can try to build it on your own.
The files are compressed tar files. They are named <code>jvm_name-os_name</code>.
For example: In the directory <code>freebsd</code> we have <code>jdk1.4.1-FreeBSD_4.9.tar.gz</code>
That is a file built on FreeBSD 4.9 using the FreeBSD JVM 1.4.1.

<section name="How do I get the executable?">
<subsection name="jsvc">
<p>
Do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Find the tar file corresponding to your configuration.</li>
  <li>Download it.</li>
  <li>Uncompress the tar file and extract it (better with gnu tar).</li>
  <li>Copy the executable to the location where you want to run it.</li>
  <li>Write an rc shell
     (see in <code>src/samples</code> and <code>src/native/unix/native/Tomcat.sh</code>)
     to get your java application started as a daemon.
  </li>
</ul>

<subsection name="procrun">

The <code>procrun.exe</code> has to be installed as a service
