Note: MAKE SURE you first build the java part (using Ant) otherwise the dist
directory is not created).

To build the service utilities for windows you will need:
- MS Visual C++ (I have used version 5.0).
- CYGWIN to build the jsvc.exe.
- A Java Platform 2 compliant SDK to run the service.

The Windows applications are found in:

apps/prunmgr
apps/prunsrv

The common source files are in

src
include
resources

The Makefiles in the apps/ directories can be used with MS Visual C++ 5.0.
They will not work with earlier versions of nmake

Note that later versions of Visual C++ can be set up to build the applications,
however they may generate executables linked with a later version of the MS "C"
runtime library (MSVCRTL), and may not work properly with all versions of Java.
