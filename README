To build the JAVA part:
ant dist

The Java portion of Commons Daemon requires Java 1.3 or later to build

To build the native part:
1 - jsvc:
  cd src/native/unix; configure; make
  You need a gnu make.
  The jsvc executable is created in the dist directory.
  There is a INSTALL.txt src/native/unix - please have a look at it.

  On Windows an additional step is needed:
  cd src/native/nt; make
  There is a README in src/native/nt - please have a look at it.
  The exe files are created in dist.
2 - procrun:
  procrun is only for windows
  cd src\native\nt\procrun\apps
  cd prunsrv
  nmake -f prunsrv.x86 (prunsrv.amd64 | prunsrv.ia64)
  cd ..\prunmgr
  nmake -f prunmgs.x86
  (It is also possible to use the MS development tools).

To build the documentation: (See http://commons.apache.org/building.html).
maven site:generate
(Do not forget to get ../commons-build: (cd ..; svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/commons-build/trunk/ commons-build))

To deploy the documentation to the apache site:
maven -Dmaven.username=${user.name} site:deploy
(Check <siteAddress/> in project.xml).
